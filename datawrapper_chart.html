		<!-- STEP ONE: Add an introduction to your dataviz here, and what story it will be a part of. -->
		<section>
			<p> Both nationally and locally, an increase in border protection has been noted from the new administration. In nearly every category reported by the CBP itself, "other" is the largest category for citizenship. This dataviz highlights that and starts to bring up the questions of that this story aims to answer.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP TWO: Add the photo of your sketched chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual photo to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->
		<img src="IMG_5026.jpg" alt="sketch of chart" height="300px" width="400px">
		

		<!-- STEP THREE: Add the screenshot of your first Datawrapper chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual screenshot to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->
		<img src="Chart_firstversion.png" alt="the first version of my chart" height="300px" width="400px">

		<!-- STEP FOUR: Add the feedback you got from your partner here. -->
		<section>
			<p> My partner gave me feedback on clarifying my subheading and heading to make it clearer, so the audience has to think less. We also both discussed the axis labels, footnotes, and annotations and brainstormed together how we could improve it for both of ours.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP FIVE: Add the iframe for your updated chart here. Replace the entire iframe below, from <iframe... to </script> -->
		<iframe title="Over 200 encounters with Customs and Border Patrol labeled as &quot;Other&quot;, the highest category" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-cvxDk" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cvxDk/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="1083" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

		<!-- STEP SIX: Explain what you changed on your chart here, and why. -->
		<section> <p> My partner gave me very specific feedback so I made a lot of the updates I made based on her suggestions. I spelled out the full name for CBP and accounted for the typo. I also made the sublime a complete sentence. Some things I want to do once I exactly know the direction of my story is add in a clearer annotation and potentially some footnotes. I would also like to figure out how to label my axis.
