			<p>The story or what I would like to report on that is interesting is crimes in the City of Syracuse/larger area, of course this is a larger topic. To narrow this down, I want to look into sexual assaults on college campuses. Or potentially even sexual assault rates that are occuring in general, there has been a shift in the media from reporting on this but lots of research says that the numbers have not gone down and are higher if anything. There is not much on this as of right now but, I found this article on Muckrock that would be a similar letter to what I would write: https://www.muckrock.com/foi/syracuse-179/records-request-from-buzzfeed-news-incident-reports-for-crimes-of-aggravated-assault-48721/. I am still having trouble with finding actual data and documents related to this. To think about timeliness a little bit more, I would like to particularly find out more about the “red zone” (https://www.thefriendshipcenter.org/post/campus-assault-bigger-than-the-red-zone)  which is when college campus sexual assaults are at a rise.
