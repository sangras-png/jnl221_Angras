How is this data organized and collected? This data is organized in the form of a table as well as a line and bar graph. The collection is from and reported by the organization itself which is U.S Customs and Border Protection. 
Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this? This dataset is newsworthy because it shows the increase in encounters that US Customs and Border Protection has had. I found this from a <a href="https://tracreports.org/reports/763/" target="_blank">report </a> on Muckrock that was talking about how the increase in criminal prosecutions by ICE. I think this would be interesting data to anyone familiar with the ICE raids in the US right now. 
What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset? The number of US Customs and Border Protection interactions will continue to gradually increase during Trumpâ€™s presidency.

How is this data organized and collected? This data is organized as a table and is collected by the CDC. 
Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this? This is newsworthy because Covid 19 had such an impact on everyones lives that people are still interested in finding any new data about it. This data has a global audience as Covid was a global pandemic. 
What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset? People that are unvaccinated are more likely to be hospitalized as a result of Covid 19 then those who are.
