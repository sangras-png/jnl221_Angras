			<p>Every year, U.S <a href="https://www.cbp.gov" target="_blank"> Customs and Border Protection </a>
 is responsible for reporting and updating statistics from their live database on encounters they have. The dataset is categorized by grouping of around four fiscal years, by area of responsibility and by state. 

		</p>


		</section>
		<section>
			<p>Over 200 documented CPB encounter occasions were labeled as “Other” when reporting citizenship. This was the largest categorization of citizenship in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/16mPC8Yuztks4yL6izPZHvwr7JK3-XhIfIk7cKvJ4jaw/edit" target="_blank"> dataset, </a> accounting for around 8,000 individual encounters. </p>

			<p>The “other” category was also the largest classification for encounters involving unaccompanied minors.</p>
		
<p> Federal law governing publicly reported data primarily focuses on accessibility and transparency rather than content specificity. <a href="https://www.cio.gov/handbook/it-laws/ogda/" target="_blank"> Open Government Data Act of 2018 </a> requires federal agencies to publish data in machine-readable formats and maintain comprehensive data inventories.
</p>

<p> Similarly, <a href="https://www.grants.gov/learn-grants/grant-policies/data-act-2014.html" target="_blank"> the DATA Act of 2014 </a> mandates that agencies disclose known limitations within their datasets. CBP notes that its systems can be slow to update and that encounter totals may appear inflated because individuals can be counted more than once in certain situations. </p>

				<h2> The top four citizenships for individual encounters

<p> CBP’s New York office was contacted for this story but did not respond.
</p>


<p> Gadi Zohar, an immigration attorney at Zohar Law PLLC, said he was uncertain about the legality of such unspecified classification but strongly disagreed with the practice.

</p>

<p> “I do not know whether this is legal or not, but I definitely do not think it should be legal for them to keep citizenship out of their public documentation,” Zohar said.


</p>

<p> Encounters are defined by the CPB as an interaction with a “removeable alien” according to their website. Previously referred to as “undocumented” or "unauthorized" people under the Biden administration, the term “alien” refers to non-citizens.

			<h3>A local and national issue</h3>
			<p>The changing of this terminology was part of President Donald Trump’s stated commitment to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/" target="_blank"> reducing diversity, equity, and inclusion measures </a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/border-immigration/" target="_blank"> enforcing stricter immigration policies. </a> In his first 100 days in office, he signed <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-first-100-days-executive-order-record/" target="_blank"> several </a> executive orders regarding these topics, including <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion//" target="_blank"> the American People Against Invasion Act. </a>
</p> 


<p>Following this on March 14, 2025, President Trump invoked <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11269" target="_blank"> the Alien Enemy Act. </a>  Last actively used during WW2, the act is a wartime law that grants the president the authority to remove individuals who have not been naturalized or are lawful permanent residents of the United States. 
</p>

<p>This has resulted in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-conflict-on-the-streets-of-chicago" target="_blank"> discourse </a>  across the nation on the effects of the move. It has caught the attention of Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Kentaji Brown Jackson. 

</p>

<p>“We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion with Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. 

</p>


<p>Despite concerns throughout the nation, both in NYS data and <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters" target="_blank"> nationwide data </a> the CPB reported a <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/nationwide-encounters" target="_blank"> decrease </a> into Jan 2025, under the Trump administration.

<iframe title="Data reports decrease in NY CPB Encounter Rates under Trump Administration" aria-label="Line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-oesMS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oesMS/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="466" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

<p>The CPB self reported data shows a decrease of over 40,000 individual encounter numbers from just December 2024 to January 2025. It is now reported to have been consistent since February of Trump’s term at around 20,000 individual encounters nationwide. 
 

</p>

<p>This includes the Southern Land Border Region, which has been publicized to be strictly regulated under both the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/12/10/thanks-president-trump-and-secretary-noem-more-25-million-illegal-aliens-left-us" target="_blank"> current </a> and <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-illegal-immigration-crisis-border-security/" target="_blank"> previous </a> Trump administration. 
</p>

<p>"I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country," said Trump,  in his inaugural address, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/nx-s1-5276139/trump-immigration-border-orders-blueprint" target="_blank"> NPR. </a>  
</p>

<p>Zohar, who has been an immigration attorney for 11 years, offered a possible explanation, citing that the Northern Land Region Border includes several unmarked disembarkation points and that people have been scared to go near a border. 
</p>

<p>“There are always clients that accidentally cross the border without knowing it. But as of late most people are not even attempting to get close to a border, in the US, they do not want to be anywhere close to a border because obviously it has gotten scarier over the past year,” Zohar said.
</p>

<p>Zohar pointed towards an increase in ICE presence as the form of immigration reform the Trump administration is using. 
</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-detainee-data-fastest-growing-without-criminal-records-trump/" target="_blank"> CBS, </a> the immigration detainees without criminal record after being arrested by ICE has increased by over 2,000% since the start of the second Trump administration in January, according to government data. 

</p>

<p>This  <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention/FY26_detentionStats11202025.xlsx" target="_blank">data </a> was released by ICE for transparency, according to the CBS, but has since been taken down. 

</p>

<p>Zohar said his clients, regardless of immigration status, fear immigration enforcement.

</p>

<p>“I think everyone is now concerned about what is going on,” he said. “Before, it was people who were undocumented who were afraid of ICE. Now it is everyone.”
